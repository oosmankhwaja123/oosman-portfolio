      <h1>H&M Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        For this Project, I chose to redesign the desktop of the H&M brand which
        is a global fashion retailer that sells clothing and accessories that
        are fashionable and affordable. The goal was to make it easier to use
        without sacrificing the aesthetics.
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="item-1">
        <div class="left-content1">
          <h2>Research1</h2>
          <p>
            I started looking at H&M and other similar brands to see what I can
            use for inspiration or get rid of. I really like how organized
            Ricki’s navigation is for their clothing because it helps the user
            have an easier time finding the certain type of clothing that they
            want to take a look at.
          </p>

        <div class="right-content1">

        <div class="left-content2">
          <h2>Research2</h2>
          <p>
            I also liked how Ricki’s had the filter options right next to the
            clothing so that you aren't required to go to a different type of
            page because it takes up more of your time to open the filter and
            then close it if you want to continue to scroll through the
            clothing.

          <h2>User Persona</h2>
          <p>
            My target audience consists of busy young adults who prioritize
            efficiency. To represent them, I created Gloria Allen, a
            career-driven individual with limited time for shopping. She prefers
            a fast, seamless online experience, which is where the H&M redesign
            comes in—to streamline her shopping process and make transactions
            quick and hassle-free.

      <div class="item-4">
        <div class="left-content4">
          <h2>User Flow1</h2>
          <p>
            I created my version of the H&M User Flow and saw some issues with
            the old one. For example, the drop-down clothing menu required you
            to do 2 actions to get to the result which is kind of weird when you
            go to a clothing menu you expect the clothing options to be
            immediately there.

        <div class="left-content5">
          <h2>User Flow2</h2>
          <p>
            For the filters for H&M you need to go to a different type of page
            in order to access the filter section, but for my user flow I
            decided to get rid of that extra page and make the filter section
            easily accessible to you, even as you are scrolling through the
            clothing.

            Also, when it comes to purchasing something on the clothing page,
            there was no option to immediately buy something right now, you
            could only add something to your bag which would take time to load
            and then you could go to the checkout. In my version, you can do
            both of those things, you can add something to your bag if you are
            not interested in buying, but you can also buy something right now
            without wasting your time.
