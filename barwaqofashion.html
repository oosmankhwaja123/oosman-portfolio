      <h1>Barwaqo Fashion Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Me and my partner created a native app for a clothing brand called
        Barwaqo Fashion that helps women seek stylish wear that balances
        modesty, affordability, and versatility. My partner was responsible for
        creating the design and layout of the app while I was mainly focused on
        the navigation, animation, and some of the layout as well.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="item-1">
        <div class="left-content1">
          <h2>Interactive Elements and Navigations1</h2>
          <p>
            I started with creating responsive inputs that would make the
            keyboard appear with a sliding animation. But I also wanted to make
            the experience feel more real by also making it so that when you
            press the keyboard, the information will appear on the inputs and
            only then can you move on to the next page. By adding these
            features, it makes the experience all the real and engaging for the
            user because people also have these experiences with other apps.

          <h2>Interactive Elements and Navigations2</h2>
          <p>
            After spending a while figuring out how some aspects of Figma works,
            I then worked on making each of the different clothing pages respond
            to the filter buttons and also the like buttons. This took a lot of
            time because I had to repeat the same process when it came to the
            responsiveness for each of the 12 different pages if you also
            include their liked versions because there had to be each filter
            page just dedicated to one clothing page because then there would be
            problems.

          <h2>Interactive Elements and Navigations3</h2>
          <p>
            When it came to working on the navigation of the payment method, I
            wanted it to start off by just showing the visuals of the payment
            options, so the user doesn’t feel overwhelmed at first when making
            the transaction. Once they choose the payment method, there will be
            an animation of the rest of the content sliding down from the top to
            make it feel more like you are making transaction in a native app
            instead of just on web app.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right-content3">
          <img
            class="payment"

      <div class="item-4">
        <div class="left-content4">
          <h2>Interactive Elements and Navigations4</h2>
          <p>
            I also made sure to know when to add sliding animations, or nothing
            when pressing to a different page because based on what type of
            button you press, there might be an animation or nothing. An example
            would be from other clothing apps such as Dynamite where I got the
            inspiration to add no animations when it came to pressing navigation
            icons but add left sliding animations for other buttons or up
            sliding animations for the filter button.

          <h2>Final Result</h2>
          <p>
            We completed the native app, and I think I accomplished what I set
            out to do, which was making the navigation of the app feel
            interactive and fluid. Below is the link to the prototype.
