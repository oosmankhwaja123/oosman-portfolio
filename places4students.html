      <h1>Places4Students Project Overview</h1>
      <p>
        For this Project, me and my partner had to redesign a web app called
        Places4Students which specializes in connecting students with rental
        places near their educational institutions. We were required to improve
        on the design and experience for the user when they want to book a
        place.

          <h2>Heuristic Evaluations</h2>
          <p>
            While conducting the Heuristic evaluations, the main issues that we
            wanted to address were how it looks unreliable, the Icons are
            confusing, and the information feels overwhelming and placed wrong.

          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
          <p>
            The target audience that we want to try and empathize with are young
            students who need to find off campus housing but also need support
            in this part of their life. The user is most likely new when it
            comes to off campus housing and living independently, so they might
            feel overwhelmed and a little bit anxious

          <h2>User Persona</h2>
          <p>
            Our main persona is Arjit Singh, a young international student who
            just graduated high school and moved abroad for higher education. He
            struggles to find temporary housing due to the overwhelming stress
            of the transition and information overload.

          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            Before creating the user flow, we first looked at a site that was
            similar to Places4Students to see what we could use as inspiration.
            Such as the fact that when searching for a home, there is a map
            mainly covering the whole screen to help you pinpoint an exact
            location that you want to look for, alongside with some helpful and
            easily accessible filters to help narrow down your choices based on
            your needs.

          <h2>Creating Prototype1</h2>
          <p>
            When we started creating the prototype, I mainly worked on the
            interactive components, the navigation, and also the layout. I spent
            a lot of time on the interactive components since I was still
            learning how to use Figma and wasn't familiar with some of its
            features yet. An example would be working on the filters for finding
            a house both on desktop and phone. I wanted the filters to look as
            easily accesible as possible and open to the user to try out. I even
            added a feature where you could see your filter options all at once
            if you don't feel like pressing each individual button.

            I also helped with organizing the Amenitites and making the icons
            bigger and easier to see because the previous design had very small
            icons that were hard to see. I also added sections to help
            categorize the icons and help the user in navigation all of the
            different icons.The picture on the left is the old design and the
            picture on the right is the new design

            We completed the final prototype and accomplished what we set out to
